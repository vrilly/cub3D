The magical cube drawing program

Included are some maps for you to use.
For quick testing of the faulty maps you can use this command:
	`find maps/err* -exec echo \; -exec echo {} \; -exec ./cub3D {} \;`
All the err* maps should give errors and not launch the cub3D game.
	If it does it will not pass eval :)

Arguments you can use:
	--nosync:	Reduce movement speed
	--save:		Render screenshot offscreen and save it as bitmap
	--conf:		Configure keymapping

Limitations:
	Max resolution for offscreen rendering is 16384*16384, minilibx can't
		handle higher due to the hardware limitations
