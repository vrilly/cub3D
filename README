The magical cube drawing program

Included are some maps for you to use.
For quick testing of the faulty maps you can use this command:
	`find maps/err* -exec echo \; -exec echo {} \; -exec ./cub3D {} \;`
All the err* maps should give errors and not launch the cub3D game.
	If it does it will not pass eval :)

For testing of mapleaks i recommend you to use mixed_map.cub and edit
the map on the fly with different test cases

Arguments you can use:
	--nosync:	Reduce movement speed
	--save:		Render screenshot offscreen and save it as bitmap
	--conf:		Configure keymapping

Custom map keys (bonus plugins):
	cub3D:
		.. = Silent map comment
		.! = Output arg to stdout when map is read
	entity:
		DE = Define entity
			args in order:
			[0-4] Slot to use for entity
				Translates to A-D in map elements
			Name to use
				Name for entity, max 16 chars
			[0|1] Collisions enabled
				Set entity to colliding
			[0-100] HP
				HP For entity
			Texture path
				Path for entity sprite texture
		IT = Change entity type to item
			Disables collisions, once player collides it will alter HP
			and destroy entity
			args in order:
			[0-4] Slot to modify, needs to be defined!
			[-100 - 100] HP Change on collision
		HP = Set player HP
			args in order:
			[0-100] HP
				Set player HP

			If not set player damage will be disabled.

Limitations:
	Max resolution for offscreen rendering is 16384*16384, minilibx can't
		handle higher due to the hardware limitations
